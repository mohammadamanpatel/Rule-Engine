# Rule Engine Project

This project consists of a Rule Engine backend and a React frontend built with Vite. The backend handles the rule processing logic, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface for users to interact with the engine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadamanpatel/Rule-Engine/
   cd rule-engine
   ```

2. For the backend, navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd rule-engine-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../rule-engine-frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Applications

#### Backend

To start the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on the port specified in the `.env` file.

#### Frontend

To start the frontend development server, navigate to the frontend directory and use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). You can view it in your web browser.

### Building for Production

#### Backend

To build the backend for production, make sure you have set the appropriate environment variables in the `.env` file. Then, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Frontend

To build the frontend application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

### Linting

To check for linting errors for both frontend and backend, use the following commands:

**Frontend:**

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Backend** (if you have a lint script in the backend `package.json`):

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Previewing the Build

**Frontend**

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Scripts

| Command (Frontend) | Description                                      |

| `npm run dev`      | Starts the development server                    |
| `npm run build`    | Builds the application for production             |
| `npm run lint`     | Runs ESLint to check for errors                  |
| `npm run preview`  | Previews the production build                     |

| Command (Backend)  | Description                                      |
